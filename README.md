# Stock-prediction-based-on-real-time-data
This is a code was the byproduct of my brother asking me to help him buy good stock based on certain parameters. In this code i use yfinance library from python which used real time data from companies who are public. The parameters used are historical data , fiboonici sequence , resistance level and moving averages.
